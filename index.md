I am a faculty at the <a href="https://www.suss.edu.sg/"> Singapore University of Social Sciences </a>. I am an economist by training and received my doctoral education from the <a href="https://www.bc.edu/bc-web/schools/morrissey/departments/economics.html"> economics department at Boston College </a>. Upon graduating, I spent about 9 years as a faculty at the <a href="https://able.adelaide.edu.au/economics-and-public-policy/"> School of Economics, University of Adelaide </a> before returning to Singapore. I am currently Deputy Director at the Centre of Applied Research, the office of research at SUSS, and formerly headed the <a href="https://www.suss.edu.sg/programmes/detail/mavi">Master and Graduate Diploma in Analytics and Visualisation</a> programmes. My former roles at Adelaide included PhD Program Chair and Faculty of Professions' Associate Dean of ICT.

I currently teach ANL501 Data Visualisation and Storytelling in the MAVI programme. My slides can be found here in the link below.

 <a  style="font-weight:bold" href="https://nicholas-sim.github.io/ANL501-Data-Visualisation-and-Storytelling/">ANL501 Data Visualisation and Storytelling</a>

This <a href="https://nicholas-sim.github.io/ANL501-Data-Visualisation-and-Storytelling/">course</a> focuses on creating data visualizations for storytelling with R as the primary tool. We will explore the use of the _ggplot2_ package to construct various visualizations to present different data types, such as bar plots, dot plots, jitter plots, boxplots, line plots, area plots, path plots, tree maps, choropleth maps, and more. Emphasis will be placed on mastering the use of Grammar of Graphics to create data visualizations for effective storytelling along with developing data preprocessing skills essential for achieving desired plots. Finally, we will explore the use of RMarkdown and data APIs for automating back-end data extraction, data wrangling, and analytics when crafting of reproducible reports.


## Other Involvements

Outside of work, I enjoy watching the Singapore Premier League and serve as a co-cathechist to eight lovely Primary 2 children at the <a href="https://sppchurch.org.sg/"> Church of St Peter and Paul </a>.
